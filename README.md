# Simple Ajax
Super simple Ajax "library" written in ES6 JS. Still a work-in-progess. Mainly done as a learning exercise.

## Features
- Supports promise-based and callback-based workflows
- Uses JavaScript modules
- Uses JSDoc comments for documentation
- Takes advantage of ES6 features for cleaner code
- Includes functions for making asynchronous requests (`Ajax.request`, `Ajax.get`, and `Ajax.post`)
- Includes a function for parsing the status of a response (`Ajax.parseStatus`)
- Includes a function for parsing the contents of a response (`Ajax.parseResponse`)
